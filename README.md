# A Genetic Algorithm for the Stochastic Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem

##Abstract

Scheduling of tasks is one of the most basic, yet most complicated tasks in any production project. The work at hand introduces a real world scheduling problem encountered at exept software AG for which we are introducing a solution approach using a genetic algorithm. The work gives background information on scheduling under resource constraints with deterministic, as well as stochastic processing times. We adopt and benchmark a genetic algorithm described in literature and achieve an improvement of median processing times of 17% as compared to the algorithm which is currently used to solve the problem. The standard deviation of processing times is reduced by 33%.

##About this Repo

This reposity contains the software created during my Masters thesis. This includes the implementation of the genetic algorithm itself, as well as various tools created during the process. However, the parser which can be used to convert XML files to our data model has been removed, since it would expose corporate secrets.
